        Find the pros vs. cons with the current designs and explain why it is good vs. bad.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The current dashboard designs have undergone various changes for various reasons. With any advancements, there are some benefits and challenges to the new designs of the dashboards. Some of the pros include the fact that many of them feature
        the Heads Up Display feature that projects essential information onto the vehicle's windscreen. A heads-up display is handy as it enables the driver to avoid any distractions associated with constantly looking down at the cluster gauge to
        identify the speed at which they are traveling. It also enables the driver to monitor the overall stats of the car, such as water and oil temperatures, without looking for the indicators on the cluster gauge. Heads-up displays current
        vehicle-related info close to the road. Heads-ups also improve the drivers' overall safety. The people inside the cars as the drivers are not distracted while driving. Young drivers are more prone to being distracted. Having the heads-up
        display enables drivers to keep an eye on the road at all times and be aware of everything that is taking place around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also some risks associated with these types of dashboards. The more and more significant the screens on the Dashboard, the easy it is for the driver to get distracted. Take, for instance, Tesla. The dashboards feature a massive
        infotainment unit at the center, right beside the driver. These screens allow the drivers to watch movies and do all sorts of things while driving. They can cause a significant distraction for the drivers, resulting in accidents. These
        dashboards also contain a variety of electronic components that are bound to become faulty and might affect the normal functioning of the vehicle. The majority of people might find it challenging to navigate the modern features and have a
        hard time enjoying their vehicles and the different features.

      Some of the standard features on car dashboards include the speedometer that helps limit or maintain the speed at which an individual is driving. Dashboards also have a tachometer that displays the rotations of the engine and shaft. It also has an odometer the measures the mileage of the vehicles. These are some of the contemporary features of the Dashboard. Other features include indicators to show something wrong with the vehicle, such as the ABS light indicator.

      List the controls that the user interacts with the car dashboards.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dashboards have various controls with which drivers get to interact with as they drive. Some of the standard controls that drivers use include temperature controls depending on the prevailing weather conditions as they drive. On a hot day, they are likely to set the temperatures low and vice versa. The other control that drivers interact with includes the hazard switch or button. They use it to indicate to other road users to drive carefully. The steering wheel also controls as it assists the drivers in determining the direction they want to go. The light controls are another thing that drivers interact with daily. They can use eth light horn or switch the lights on and off depending on the day they are driving.

    <h3>
      What are some common mistakes you can make with this current designs?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some of the common mistakes that an individual can make include pushing the wrong button while driving, as the designs are interactive and more immersive than ever. The buttons or switches can have multiple functions, and it can be challenging to understand them all at once. The dashboards might also not have all the buttons and switches labeled or assigned a function; hence it can be challenging to know what they do. With the impressiveness of the new dashboard designs, it is also effortless for a person to get sidetracked with what they were doing as there are a lot of features and aspects to take in at once.

    <p>
      I'm trying to make it all very compact and letting the user gather as much information as possible from a single glance. As everything can be viewed from a user can easily know the speed, and Fuel at the same time as they are more important.
      With added colors it is very easy to understand the fuel level of the car. All the warning signs also placed in a signle column which allows the user to get all the warning signs easily.
      Trip information is also just below the speed. This dashboard was made for the cars in America, for this reason the MPH has not been shown which felt like uneccesaary information.
      All the calculations such as Distance, Trip, RPM, Speed all are measured in imperial units.

      reference for my calculations is Ford Mustang. Ihave researched the gear ratios Tire size to show the accurate RPM distance and speed for the Dashboard.
    </p>
  <p>  transmissionRatios = [3.35, 1.93, 1.29, 1.0, 0.68] # individual transmission ratios of each gear. Assuming the car has 5 gears excluding Reverse and Neutral</p>
  <p>rearEndRatio = 3.15 #:1</p>
  <p>tireSize = 29 # inches </p>
  <p>RPM = speed * transmission Ratio of the gear * rear end ration * 336 / tire size</p>
  <p>distance = ((PI * tireSize * totalTime * RPM)/(63360* 60000))</p>
